- Downloaded three models mBERT, XLM, distilBERT
- huggface has a sentence transformers organization
- st org models are miniLM, distilBERT, and XLM

Expirement #1: are clusters consisent throughout sentence blocks
- create dataset of 100 sentence blocks v/
- get embeddings of each block v/
- cluster the block using wss and k-means v/
    within clusters sum of squares v/
- compare the clusters

To do:
- finish wcss algo v/

- wss analysis seems to suggest 5 is the best number of groups
    - it should be noted that changes in the vectors are relatively small

Oct 3
- something is wrong with wcss
    - the wcss value of the 15 cluster group should be 0
    - average is wrong
- wcss is a smooth curve, this might sugguest that all elements are equally spaced
